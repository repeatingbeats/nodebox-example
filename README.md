# nodebox-example

nodebox-example is "Hello World" for Node.js, but it's sandboxed in a VirtualBox VM. Experiment with Node, blow it up, start over. Configure a development VM with code reloading and Node listening on port 80, or configure a production-ish VM with nginx proxying to a daemonized Node process.
